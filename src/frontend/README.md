# Introduction to Create React App

This project was initiated using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts You Can Use

Within the project directory, the following commands can be executed:

### `npm start`

This command runs the application in development mode.  
Access [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to see the app.

Any changes you make will cause the page to reload automatically.  
Lint errors, if any, will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

This command starts the test runner in an interactive watch mode.  
For further details, visit [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

This command compiles the application for production into the `build` directory.  
It assembles React in production mode and optimizes the build for optimal performance.

The output is minified, and filenames contain hashes.  
The application is then ready for deployment.

For more information, refer to [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Warning: `eject` is irreversible! Once done, you cannot undo it!**

If the default build tool and configuration don't meet your needs, `eject` allows you to customize them. This command eliminates the single build dependency from your project.

It then copies all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (like webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you complete control. After ejecting, you can still use all other commands, but they will refer to the newly copied scripts, which you can modify as needed. From this point, you are in charge.

You don't need to use `eject`. It’s designed for small to medium-sized deployments, and it’s not compulsory to use it. However, if you need customization later, `eject` becomes relevant.
